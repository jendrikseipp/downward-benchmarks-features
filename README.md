# Feature values for PDDL tasks

The `features.json` file contains [feature
values](https://github.com/fawcettc/planning-features) for all tasks from
the [downward-benchmarks](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks)
repository. The values have been computed with the scripts under
`experiments`. The sentinel feature value `-512.0` signals that the value
could not be computed.
